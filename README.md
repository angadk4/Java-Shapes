# Java Shapes Projecs

## Introduction
This project is a culmination of three assignments from the 2ME3 Fall 2023 course, showcasing an advanced Java application designed to simulate and detect intersections between various geometric shapes.

## Project Description
The Java Shape Intersection Project is a module that implements complex object-oriented programming concepts. It features various geometric shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and line segments, and efficiently detects intersections among them.

### Key Components
1. **Shape Implementation**: Utilizes Java to create abstract and concrete shape classes based on a provided UML class diagram.
2. **Collision Detection**: Implements algorithms for detecting intersections between shapes like rectangles and circles.
3. **Test Cases and Examples**: Includes a `Main.java` file with sample test cases demonstrating the functionality of shape intersection detection.
4. **Design Patterns**: Various design patters were used to create additional components, such as a composite shape, and an iterator.

## Features
- Implementation of abstract and concrete shape classes in Java.
- Efficient collision detection algorithm for various shapes.
- Example test cases to demonstrate the application's capabilities.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. **Compile the Java Files**: Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files.
3. **Run Main.java**: Execute the `Main.java` file to see some basic test cases in action.

## Credits
This project was developed as part of the 2ME3 Fall 2023 course. Special thanks to the course instructors and TAs for their guidance and support.
